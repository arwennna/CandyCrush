This project is a variation of the popular Connect3 board game, with a functional GUI, menu and different level options. In the  beginning of the game, the starting grid is randomly generated. The player has a limited number of moves, in which he is supposed  to exchange fields based on their colours. If he manages to connect 3 or more consecutive same-coloured fields, his score gets  increased linearly with the number of the connected fields.
